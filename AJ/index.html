        honor Dr. Katalin Karikó who was awarded a Nobel Prize last year for her work in mRNA research. She received
        both her undergraduate degree as well as her PhD here. However, she is not the first Nobel laureate from the
        university as Dr. Albert Szent-Györgyi received the award in 1937 after isolating ascorbic acid (vitamin C) for
        the first time here.</p>
